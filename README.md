Most of the samples are not particularly interesting yet with the exception of BouncingBalls and Canon.
These are definitely worth checking out.
The code is complicated for beginners but just running them can be fun.


It should run with just a standard install of Processing, no libraries needed.



Installing Processing:

1) Go to Processing.org
2) Click Download on the left side
3) Click on your operating system (likely Windows 64-bit or Max OS X)
   This will download a zip archive named: processing-3.3.7-windows64.zip
4) The zip will need to be extracted, click on "Extract all" (toolbar, far right)
   Enter a location to extract, this can be anywhere.
   I'd recommend creating a folder \java for your programming tools.
5) In your folder you'll see a folder processing-3.3.7 with processing.exe
6) I'd recommend starting processing then right click on the icon in the taskbar to Pin.
